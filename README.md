This project is about a list of Station ID that have the same value as the input(Station ID).

For MesoAscii.java
1. Write a constructor with a MesoStation parameter.
2. Write calAverage method with return value (int).
  -use a for loop to get the letter value and calculate its average

For MesoEqual.java
1. Write a constructor with a String parameter.
2. Write a read method to read the Mesonet.txt with no return values.
  -use bufferedReader to read the content
3. Create a HashMap object to store the IDs in the list.
4. Create an ArrayList to store the IDs as String in the list.
5. Write a calAsciiEqual method with return value of HashMap list.
  -use the for loop to read through each station name
    *call the calAverage method from MesoAscii to calculate each average value

For StationLexicographical.java
1. Create a TreeMap object to copy the list of station IDs and value to store the sorted list.
2. Write a constructor with HashMap object as the parameter.
3. Write a sortedMap method with the return value of Map list
